# C-Final-Project

This was a project I worked on for my c++ intro to programming class.
This project is currently unfinished but usable.

# What is this?

This is a simple text based game you can run in Visual Studios.
The game is turn-based combat. Users start by typing in their character name. Then they choose which class they would like to play. The user has to fight 5 monsters and kill them to win. They can choose any order to fight the monsters, however, some are very difficult. After entering a fight, the user sees his hp and mp. He is then prompted to choose attack, special attack, or items. After the user makes his/her decision the monster will attack. If the users hp falls below 1 at any point the game ends and they lose. If the monsterâ€™s hp falls below 1 the user levels up and gets any loot the monster drops. When all 5 monsters are killed the game ends in victory.
